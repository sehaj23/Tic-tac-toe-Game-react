# React Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React. It allows two players to take turns marking their 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The game declares a winner when one player has three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or it ends in a draw if the grid is full.
